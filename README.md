# Genetic-Algorithm
Genetic Algorithm to create the design of a lamp which shines its bulb at a certain point in 3D space with the help of NX open.

The main goal of this project was to create an algorithm which utilizes the Guided Random Search techniques of a Genetic Algorithm to create some design of a simple table lamp. The only condition this design has to satisfy is that the lightbulb points in the direction of the input point in 3D space.
